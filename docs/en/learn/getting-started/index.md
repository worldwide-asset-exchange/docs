# Getting Started with WAX Blockchain

Welcome to WAX, the Worldwide Asset eXchangeâ„¢ - a purpose-built blockchain designed for NFTs, gaming, collectibles, and more. WAX offers instant transactions, low fees, and true ownership of digital assets with environmental sustainability.

This Getting Started Guide covers everything you need to know to begin using and developing on the WAX blockchain.

## Quick Start

New to WAX? Get up and running in minutes:

- [WAX Wallets](/learn/getting-started/wallets/) - Choose the right wallet for your needs

## For Users

### Account and Wallet Setup

To interact with WAX, you'll need a WAX account and a wallet to manage your private keys:

- [WAX Wallets](/learn/getting-started/wallets/) - Overview of available wallets

- Use WAXP for transaction fees
- Participate in governance
- [Learn more about WAXP](/learn/about-wax/what-is-waxp-token)

### Managing Resources

WAX uses a unique resource model where you can:

- **CPU**: Rent CPU power for transaction processing
- **NET**: Rent network bandwidth for data transfer
- **RAM**: Purchase memory for account data storage

### PowerUp

PowerUp is the primary way to pay for transactions on WAX. This resource rental system allows users to temporarily boost their account's CPU and NET resources.

It is perfect for users who need reliable transaction processing without committing to long-term staking.

### Staking (Alternative Method)

Alternatively, you can stake WAXP tokens to earn CPU and NET resources:

- **Voter Rewards**: Earn additional rewards for participating in governance
- **Suitable for**: Heavy users who prefer predictable resource allocation

Staking is ideal for users who frequently transact and want to participate in WAX governance.

WAX is the leading blockchain for NFTs and digital collectibles:

- Trade NFTs on WAX's many [marketplaces](/create/awesome-wax/#nft-marketplaces)
- Create and manage digital assets
- Participate in our rich gaming ecosystems
