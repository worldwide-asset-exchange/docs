# React Native SDK
## Overview of WAX Cloud Wallet SDK

The WAX Cloud Wallet React Native SDK enables seamless integration between decentralized applications (dApps) and the WAX Cloud Wallet mobile app. This SDK provides developers with a robust solution for implementing blockchain transactions in their React Native applications, offering two flexible connection modes:
   1. **WebSocket Mode**: Enables cross-device communication between your dApp and the WAX Cloud Wallet app. This mode is perfect for scenarios where users want to sign transactions using their WAX Cloud Wallet app on a different device than the one running the dApp.
   2. **Direct Mode**: Provides direct integration when both the dApp and WAX Cloud Wallet app are installed on the same device, offering a smooth, native-like experience through deep linking.

The SDK abstracts the complexity of blockchain interactions, allowing developers to focus on building great user experiences while ensuring secure transaction signing and user authentication.
