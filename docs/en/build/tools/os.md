# Supported Operating Systems

WAX currently supports the following operating systems:

* Ubuntu 22.04 Jammy
* Ubuntu 20.04 Focal
* Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic

## Virtual Machines

If you're using a virtual machine for development, it should be configured with at least 2 CPUs (does not have to be two physical ones) and 8G of memory.

## Windows Users

The quickest, easiest way to run the WAX Blockchain on Windows is to use our Docker images. Refer to [Docker Quickstart](/build/dapp-development/docker-setup/) to get started. 

If you're an advanced Window's developer with an understanding of Linux, you do have other options:

* Use Microsoft's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10" target="_blank">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a>
* Use <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank">VirtualBox</a> (or a similar app) to create a Linux virtual machine
* Use Microsoft's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/about/" target="_blank">Hyper-V on Windows 10</a> to create a Linux virtual machine
