# How to Submit a WAX Labs Proposal

## 1. Ensure the Project Qualifies to Receive Funding

WAX Labs funds initiatives that advance the WAX ecosystem — including open‑source tools, critical infrastructure, and products like games and dapps, provided there is clear community benefit and measurable impact. In 2025, WAX Labs expanded its scope to include support for product launches. See: [Streamlining Governance & Funding](https://wax-io.medium.com/streamlining-governance-funding-the-next-chapter-for-wax-blockchain-b1dc2e6d2026), [Building the Future of Web3 — Powered by WAX Labs](https://wax-io.medium.com/building-the-future-of-web3-powered-by-wax-labs-33537fb8f4c7).

Examples of projects that may qualify:

- Open‑source code/tools/features (MIT or similar)
- Products (games, dapps) that demonstrate clear WAX ecosystem benefit, KPIs, and a roadmap

Projects that are unlikely to qualify:

- General NFT collections or undifferentiated marketplace clones
- Sponsorship requests without direct ecosystem impact
- Proposals lacking a clear plan, metrics, or delivery accountability

If unsure whether the project qualifies, reach out to the WAX team or the WAX Office of Inspector General.

## 2. Create a WAX Account & Complete WAX Labs Profile

Ensure that the proposer has a WAX account. If one is needed, the proposer can create an account using the WAX Cloud Wallet or various other wallet providers.

Log in to WAX Labs and complete the profile by clicking on the WAX account name in the top right. Make sure that the profile is memorable and detailed to increase the chances of a successful proposal.

## 3. Prepare the Proposal

Proposers should craft a detailed proposal that outlines the project. Address:

- The problem/opportunity and how the project provides value
- A clear description of the product/service and target users
- Milestone‑based timelines and acceptance criteria
- License and tech stack (if applicable)
- Team, experience, and delivery plan with KPIs

An example successful proposal template can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jC8fIuwZMIjDkZqvUmg58Cp_vRpwofDwLQIZnJC8icg/edit?usp=sharing).

Projects that are high quality, polished, and include demos or early traction are more likely to be approved.

The character limit of various fields are provided below:
- Title - 64 characters
- Description - 160 characters
- Content - 4,096 characters*
- Financial Roadmap - 4,096 characters*

**It is recommended to limit these fields to 3750 characters max because WAX Labs adds additional characters when converting to markdown format.*

## 4. Submit the Draft Proposal

Fill out the submission form, providing all the required information. Additional materials may be provided by linking to them within the content and financial roadmap sections. The platform will automatically convert the proposal submission to markdown upon submission.

A small fee of 100 WAX tokens is required on draft submission to prevent spam on the platform.

It’s okay if the proposal is not finished in one sitting. The WAX Labs platform saves the proposal once it is submitted as a draft. However, be aware that anything saved as a draft can be viewed by others on the platform and the smart contract via a block explorer. Most proposers find it easiest to write the proposal in a word processor first and then transfer it to the submission form when they are ready to submit.

## 5. Add Deliverables to Draft Proposal

After the proposal draft is created, return to the draft and add deliverables and expected time to completion. Amounts requested on deliverables are pegged to USD and the WAX amount rewarded is frozen at the time the deliverable is approved by the WAX team.

## 6. Submit Final Proposal, Wait for Review, and Engage with the Community

Once the deliverables are added, submit the proposal for review. The review process generally takes ~1 month. The WAX team and WAX Office of Inspector General assess proposal quality, ecosystem benefit, and readiness per the criteria above.

Throughout the process, especially during the waiting period, build reputation by actively participating in the WAX community (Telegram, Discord, X Spaces). Socialize proposals with prominent community members to obtain feedback and demonstrate professionalism.

## 7. Respond to Feedback

Proposals can be Approved, Rejected, or placed in “To Be Improved.” Address feedback, update the proposal, and resubmit for a new decision in the next review meeting.

## 8. Receive Approval or Rejection

If approved, begin executing the project and follow any additional instructions for reporting. If rejected, you can request additional feedback and potentially resubmit after improvements.

## 9. Complete Deliverables and Claim Funding

Funding is disbursed only after deliverables are completed and approved. Submit completion reports via the WAX Labs platform. If claiming fails, contact the WAX Office of Inspector General or WAX team; the funding account may need to be topped up.
