WAX Labs exists to fund and support projects that drive the WAX ecosystem forward. From trailblazing platforms like Uncut and AtomicHub to innovative tools from new builders, WAX Labs provides the resources to move from vision to launch.

Support may come in the form of milestone-based funding, grant support, or advisory guidance — but it comes with expectations around delivery, transparency, and impact. If you’re ready to build something that serves the WAX community, WAX Labs is ready to back you.

## How the WAX Labs Proposal Process Works

Got an idea? Start here:

- Draft Your Proposal: Outline your project goals, budget (in WAX), milestones, and key success metrics.
- Submit for Review: Once submitted, your proposal is locked and sent to the WAX team.
- Team Review: A team member may reach out to schedule a meeting to clarify goals and discuss execution.
- Approved & In Progress: Upon approval, funding is distributed in stages as milestones are met.
- Final Completion: Once your work is complete and deliverables are validated, the final payout is made.
